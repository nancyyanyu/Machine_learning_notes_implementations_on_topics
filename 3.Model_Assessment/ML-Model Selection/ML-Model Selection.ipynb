    "#### Drawbacks of least squares estimates:\n",
    "\n",
    "- *prediction accuracy*: the least squares estimates often have low bias but large variance. Prediction accuracy can sometimes be improved by shrinking or setting some coeﬃcients to zero.By doing so we sacriﬁce a little bit of bias to reduce the variance of the predicted values, and hence may improve the overall prediction accuracy.\n",
    "- *interpretation*: With a large number of predictors, we often would like to determine a smaller subset that exhibit the strongest eﬀects. In order to get the “big picture,” we are willing to sacriﬁce some of the small details.\n",

    "## Best Subset Selection\n",
    "\n",
    "Best subset regression ﬁnds for each k ∈{0, 1, 2,...,p} the subset of size k that gives smallest residual sum of squares.\n",
    "\n",
    "We choose the smallest model that minimizes an estimate of the expected prediction error.\n",

    "> FIGURE 3.5.All possible subset models for the prostate cancer example. At each subset size is shown the residual sum-of-squares for each model of that size.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "**Approach**\n",
    "\n",
    "1. fit a separate least squares regression best subset for each possible combination of the p predictors. That is, we fit all p models selection that contain exactly one predictor, all $\\left(\\begin{array}{c}p\\\\ 2\\end{array}\\right)= p(p−1)/2$ models that contain exactly two predictors, and so forth. \n",
    "2. We then look at all of the resulting\n",
    "   models, with the goal of identifying the one that is best.\n",

    "<img src=\"./1.png\" width=\"600\" />\n",
    "\n",
    "**Note**\n",
    "\n",
    "- $RSS$ of these p + 1 models decreases monotonically, and the $R2$ increases\n",
    "  monotonically, as the number of features included in the models increases.\n",
    "  Therefore, if we use these statistics to select the best model, then we will\n",
    "  always end up with a model involving all of the variables\n",
    "- The problem of selecting the best model from among the $2^p$ possibilities\n",
    "  considered by best subset selection is not trivial.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Stepwise Selection\n",
    "\n",
    "> Rather than search through all possible subsets (which becomes infeasible for p much larger than 40), we can seek a good path through them.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Forward Stepwise Selection\n",
    "\n",
    "**Forward-stepwise selection** starts with the intercept, and then sequentially adds into the model the predictor that most improves the ﬁt.\n",
    "\n",
    "Forward-stepwise selection is a *greedy algorithm*, producing a nested sequence of models. In this sense it might seem sub-optimal compared to best-subset selection. \n",
    "\n",
    "#### Advantages:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Computational**: for large p we cannot compute the best subset sequence, but we can always compute the forward stepwise sequence\n",
    "- **Statistical**: a price is paid in variance for selecting the best subset of each size; forward stepwise is a more constrained search, and will have lower variance, but perhaps more bias\n",
    "\n",
    "**Approach**\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Forward stepwise selection** begins with a model containing no predictors, and then adds predictors\n",
    "   to the model, one-at-a-time, until all of the predictors are in the model.\n",
    "2. In particular, at each step the variable that gives the greatest additional\n",
    "   improvement to the fit is added to the model.\n",
    "\n",
    "<img src=\"./2.png\" width=\"600\" />\n",
    "\n",
    "**Forward Stepwise Selection V.S. Best Subset Selection**\n",
    "\n",
    "- Forward stepwise selection’s computational advantage over best subset\n",
    "  selection is clear. \n",
    "- Forward stepwise is not guaranteed to find the best possible model out of all $2^p$ models\n",
    "  containing subsets of the p predictors.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Backward Stepwise Selection\n",
    "\n",
    "**Backward-stepwise selection** starts with the full model, and sequentially deletes the predictor that has the least impact on the ﬁt. The candidate for dropping is the variable with the smallest Z-score\n",
    "\n",
    "**Approach**\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Backward Stepwise Selection** begins with the full least squares model containing all p predictors, and then iteratively removes the least useful predictor, one-at-a-time\n",
    "\n",
    "<img src=\"./3.png\" width=\"600\" />\n",
    "\n",
    "**Backward Stepwise Selection V.S. Forward Stepwise Selection**:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Like forward stepwise selection, the backward selection approach searches\n",
    "  through only 1+p(p+1)/2 models, and so can be applied in settings where\n",
    "  p is too large to apply best subset selection.\n",
    "- Like forward stepwise selection, backward stepwise selection is not guaranteed to yield the best\n",
    "  model containing a subset of the p predictors.\n",
    "- Backward selection requires that the number of samples n is larger than\n",
    "  the number of variables p (so that the full model can be fit). In contrast,\n",
    "  forward stepwise can be used even when n < p, and so is the only viable\n",
    "  subset method when p is very large.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Hybrid Approaches\n",
    "\n",
    "**Approach**\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Variables are added to the model sequentially, in analogy to forward selection. \n",
    "2. However, after adding each new variable, the method\n",
    "   may also remove any variables that no longer provide an improvement in\n",
    "   the model fit. \n",
    "\n",
    "**Note**\n",
    "\n",

    "## High-Dimensional Data\n",
    "\n",
    "**High-dimensional**: Data sets containing more features than observations are often referred\n",
    "to as high-dimensional.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Classical approaches such as least squares linear regression are not appropriate in this setting\n",
    "\n",
    "## What Goes Wrong in High Dimensions?\n",
    "\n",
    "1. When the number of features p is as large as, or >n, least squares cannot be performed.\n",
    "\n",
    " **Reason**: regardless of whether or not there truly is a relationship between the features and the response,\n",
    "least squares will yield a set of coefficient estimates that result in a perfect fit to the data, such that the residuals are zero.\n",
    "\n",
    "- This perfect fit will almost certainly lead to overfitting of the data\n",
    "- The problem is simple: when p > n or p ≈ n, a simple least squares regression line is too ***flexible*** and hence overfits the data.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Examines only the R2 or the training set MSE might erroneously conclude that the model with the greatest number of variables is best.\n",
    "   <img src=\"./12 2.png\" width=\"650\" />\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Cp, AIC, and BIC** approaches are not appropriate in the high-dimensional setting, because estimating $\\hat{σ}^2$ is problematic.(For instance, the formula for $\\hat{σ}^2$ from Chapter 3 yields an\n",
    "  estimate $\\hat{σ}^2$ = 0 in this setting.) \n",
    "- **Adjusted $R^2$ ** in the high-dimensional setting is problematic, since one can easily obtain\n",
    "  a model with an adjusted $R^2$ value of 1.\n",

    "## Regression in High Dimensions\n",
    "\n",
    "**Alternative approaches better-suited to the high-dimensional setting:**\n",

    "\n",
    "### Curse of dimensionality\n",
    "\n",
    "Adding additional signal features\n",

    "noise features that are not truly associated with the response will lead\n",
    "to a deterioration in the fitted model.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Reason**: This is because noise features increase the dimensionality of the problem, exacerbating the risk of overfitting (since noise features may be\n",

    "## Interpreting Results in High Dimensions\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Be cautious in reporting the results obtained when we perform the lasso, ridge regression, or other regression procedures in the high-dimensional setting.\n",
    "\n",
    "- In the high-dimensional setting, the **multicollinearity**\n",

    "  predictive of the outcome, and we can never identify the best coefficients\n",
    "  for use in the regression.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Be cautious in reporting errors and measures of model fit in the high-dimensional setting\n",
    "\n",
    "- e.g.: when p > n, it is easy to obtain a useless model that has zero residuals.\n",
    "- **One should never use sum of squared errors, p-values, R2 statistics, or other traditional measures of model fit on the training data as\n",
    "  evidence of a good model fit in the high-dimensional setting**\n",
    "- It is important to\n",
