    "**Reason of using other fitting procedure than lease squares**:\n",
    "- ***Prediction Accuracy:*** \n",
    " - Provided that the true relationship between the response and the predictors is approximately linear, the least squares estimates will have low bias. \n",
    " - If n $\\gg$ p, least squares estimates tend to also have low variance $\\Rightarrow$ perform well on test data.\n",
    " - If n is not much larger than p, least squares fit has large variance $\\Rightarrow$ overfitting $\\Rightarrow$ consequently poor predictions on test data\n",
    " - If p > n, no more unique least squares coefficient estimate: the **variance is infinite** so the method cannot be used at all\n",
    " \n",
    "  By **constraining** or **shrinking** the estimated coefficients, we can often substantially reduce the variance at the cost of a negligible increase in bias.\n",
    "  \n",
    "- ***Model Interpretability***：\n",
    " - irrelevant variables leads to unnecessary complexity in the resulting model. By removing these\n",
    "variables—that is, by setting the corresponding coefficient estimates\n",
    "to zero—we can obtain a model that is more easily interpreted. \n",
    " - least squares is extremely unlikely to yield any coefficient estimates that are exactly zero $\\Rightarrow$ **feature selection**\n",
