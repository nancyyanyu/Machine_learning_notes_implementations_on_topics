    "prediction, which is simply the *mean of the response values* for the\n",
    "training observations in Rj .\n",
    "\n",
    "### Step 1\n",
    "\n",
    "**How do we construct the regions\n",
    "R1, . . .,RJ?** \n",
    "- We choose to divide the predictor space into high-dimensional rectangles, or\n",
    "**boxes**, for ease of interpretation of the resulting predictive\n",

    "\n",
    "**Recursive Binary Splitting**: a *top-down, greedy* approach\n",
    "- **Top-down**: begins at the top of the tree (at which point\n",
    "all observations belong to a single region) and then successively splits the\n",
    "predictor space; each split is indicated via two new branches further down\n",
    "on the tree. \n",

    "the best split is made at that particular step, rather than looking ahead\n",
    "and picking a split that will lead to a better tree in some future step.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Methods**:\n",
    "1. Select the predictor $X_j$ and the cutpoint $s$ such that splitting the predictor space into\n",
    "the regions ${X|X_j < s}$ and ${X|X_j ≥ s}$ leads to the greatest possible\n",

    "\\end{align}\n",
    "where $\\hat{y}_{R_1}$is the mean response for the training observations in $R_1(j, s)$,\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Repeat the process, looking for the best predictor and best\n",
    "cutpoint in order to split the data further so as to minimize the RSS within\n",
    "each of the resulting regions. \n",
    " - However, this time, instead of splitting the\n",
    "entire predictor space, we split one of the two previously identified regions.\n",
    "\n",
    " - We now have three regions. Again, we look to split one of these three regions\n",
