    "As in bagging, we build a number  of decision trees on bootstrapped training samples. But when building these decision trees, each time a split in a tree is considered, *a random sample of m predictors is chosen as split candidates* from the full set of p predictors.\n",
    "\n",
    "**The split is allowed to use only one of those m predictors.** A fresh sample of m predictors is taken at each split, and typically we choose $m ≈\\sqrt{p}$ \n",

    "- Suppose that there is one very strong predictor in the data set, along with a number of other moderately strong predictors.

    "- Unlike fitting a single large decision tree to the data, which amounts to fitting the data hard and potentially overfitting, the boosting approach instead **learns slowly**. \n",
    "- Given the current model, we fit a decision tree to the residuals from the model. That is, we fit a tree using the current residuals, rather than the outcome Y , as the response.\n",
    "- We then add this new decision tree into the fitted function in order to update the residuals. Each of these trees can be rather small, with just a few terminal nodes, determined by the parameter **d** in the algorithm. \n",
    "- By fitting small trees to the residuals, we slowly improve $\\hat{f}$ in areas where it does not perform well. \n",
    "- The shrinkage parameter **λ** slows the process down even further, allowing more and different shaped trees to attack the residuals.\n",
    "\n",
    "> Note that in boosting, unlike in bagging, the construction of each tree depends strongly on the trees that have already been grown.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Boosting has three tuning parameters:**\n",
    "\n",
    "1. The number of trees $B$.\n",
    "2. The shrinkage parameter $λ$, a small positive number. This controls the rate at which boosting learns.\n",
    "3. The number $d$ of splits in each tree, which controls the complexity of the boosted ensemble. Often d = 1 works well, in which case each tree is a **stump**, consisting of a single split. In this case, the boosted ensemble is fitting an **additive model**, since each term involves only a single variable. More generally $d$ is the **interaction depth**, and controls the interaction order of the boosted model, since $d$ splits can involve  at most d variables.\n",

    "\n",
    "\n",
    "**Boosting V.S. Random forests:**\n",
    "\n",
    "- In boosting, because the growth of a particular tree takes into account the other trees that have already been grown, smaller trees are typically sufficient. \n",
