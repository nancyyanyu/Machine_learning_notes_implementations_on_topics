    "# Hierarchical Clustering\n",
    "\n",
    "**Hierarchical clustering** is an alternative approach which does not require that we commit to a particular choice of $K$. \n",
    "\n",
    "- Added advantage over K-means clustering in that it results in an attractive tree-based representation of the observations, called a ***dendrogram***.\n",

    "In the left-hand panel of Figure 10.9, each *leaf* of the dendrogram representsone of the 45 observations in Figure 10.8. \n",
    "\n",
    "- As we move up the tree, some leaves begin to **fuse** into branches: observations that are similar to each other. \n",
    "\n",
    "- The earlier(lower in the tree) fusions occur, the more similar the groups of observationsare to each other. \n",
    "- For any two observations, we can look for the point in the tree where branches containing those two observations are first fused.\n",
    "  - The *height* of this fusion, as measured on the vertical axis, indicates how different the two observations are.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Thus, observations that fuse at the very bottom of the tree are quite similar to each other, whereas observationsthat fuse close to the top of the tree will tend to be quite different.\n",

    "**Identifying clusters on the basisof a dendrogram**:\n",
    "\n",
    "Make a *horizontal cut* across the dendrogram, as shown in the center and right-hand panels of Figure 10.9. The distinct sets of observations beneath the cut can be interpreted as clusters.\n",

    "\n",
    "**Explanation:**\n",
    "\n",
    "The two clusters that are most similar to each other are then fused so that there now are n−1 clusters. Next the two clusters that are most similar to each other arefused again, so that there now are n − 2 clusters. The algorithm proceeds in this fashion until all of the observations belong to one single cluster, and the dendrogram is complete.\n",

    "> How did we determine that the cluster {5, 7} should be fused with the cluster {8}? - linkage\n",
    "\n",
    "**Linkage** : defines the *dissimilarity* between two groups of observations.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Complete, average, single, and centroid\n",
    "- The dissimilarities computed in Step 2(b)of the hierarchical clustering algorithm will depend on the type of linkage used, as well as on the choice of dissimilarity measure.\n",

    "## Choice of Dissimilarity Measure\n",

    "**Dissimilarity Measure**:\n",
    "\n",
    "- ***Euclidean distance***\n",
    "- ***Correlation-based distance***: considers two observationsto be similar if their features are highly correlated\n",
    "\n",
    "In general, careful attention should be paid to the *type* of data being clustered and the scientific question at hand which determines what type of dissimilarity measureis used for hierarchical clustering.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "**Note:** variables should be ***scaled*** to have standarddeviation one before the dissimilarity between the observations iscomputed.\n",

    "\n",
    "## Small Decisions with Big Consequences\n",
    "\n",
    "In order to perform clustering, some decisions must be made.\n",

    "- Should the observations or features first be standardized to have mean zero and scaled to have standard deviation one.\n",
    "- In the case of hierarchical clustering,\n",
    "  - What dissimilarity measure should be used?\n",
    "  - What type of linkage should be used?\n",
    "  - Where should we cut the dendrogramin order to obtain clusters?\n",
    "- In the case of K-means clustering, how many clusters should we lookfor in the data?\\\\\n",

    "We try several different choices, and look for the one withthe most useful or interpretable solution.\n",
